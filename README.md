## Overview of the statistical analysis
The boss W. Avy likes an Idea I proposed about opening and funding a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii.  Using Pandas, SQLlite, Python, and SQLalchemy we will show W. Avy what information he seeks before funding.  Having experience in this before he wants the temperature data for June and December to see if its sustainable.

## Results

Below you will see the weather in june recorded in our analysis.  You can see the min temperature recorded in June was 64 degrees and the high was 85 degrees

( - )  The 50% quartile show 71 for december and 75 for June
## Summary
I don't think there were any surprises here for anyone that has been to Hawaii.  The temperatues are generally close.  However I would want to know a few more things.  I would want to know the average daylight in June vs December becasue that would affect the amount of time the shop is open.  I would also want to know the months of hurricanes and how it would affect business. Wind speeds would also be important.  Although surfing is generally good year round in Oahu the waves can be extreme in some places and only for experts.
